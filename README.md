# glc

glc is an experimental language, based on Go. glc is a placeholder name
that stands for something like "Go-like C".

This is barely past the "I want Go without a GC and with a C ABI" stage.
Likely will not have goroutines or channels. This is more about taking
the obvious improvements Go made to C, at least from my perspective, and
starting from there as a place to dabble in language design.

And maybe, as a practical replacement for my C/C++ programming.
